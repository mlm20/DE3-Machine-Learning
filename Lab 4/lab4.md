# Lab 4 â€“ Pytorch and Convolutional Deep Networks

## Setup

### Method

The source code from _Lab 3_ was modified in order to enable Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional layers were created which, in addition to the dimension attributes, feature attributes for the dimensions of the convolution kernel, as well as image padding.

Furthermore, the code which makes the network run is ammended as it now accepts a matrix as an input, rather than a vector.

#### Results

The resulting model had the following accuracies when run twice: 0.96, 0.894.

#### Comments

The accuracy level is about the same as that of the deep (non-convolutional) neural network from Lab 3. However in comparison to the network from Lab 3, this network takes significantly longer to run.
