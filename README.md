# DE3 Machine Learning

This repo cover the labs and projects completed as part of the `Machine Learning` Module I completed in the Third Year of Design Engineering (MEng) at Imperial College London.

The module covered the mathematical fundamentals of ML, basic implementation in Python, as well as more advanced uses using `PyTorch`.
